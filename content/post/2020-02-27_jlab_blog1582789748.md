# Github提供免费3员工私有代码库 Free private Github repository license 3 employees Open
+ As title said, it is convenience to StartUps, and bundled youe company to Github
+ It is a promotion bait  for programmer~!
+ Enjoy it!
+ Source text
+ If you’re a [GitHub user](https://github.com/), but you don’t pay, this is a good week. Historically, [GitHub ](https://crunchbase.com/organization/github) always offered free accounts but the caveat was that your code had to be public. To get private repositories, you had to pay. Starting tomorrow, that limitation is gone. Free GitHub users now get unlimited private projects with up to three collaborators.
